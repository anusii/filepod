# File Pod Installers

Flutter supports multiple platform targets. Flutter based apps can run
native on Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as directly
in a browser from the web. Flutter functionality is essentially
identical across all platforms so the experience across different
platforms will be very similar.

There are no specific prerequisites for installing and running the
app.

## Android

You can side load the latest version of the app by downloading the
[installer](https://solidcommunity.au/installers/filepod.apk)
through your Android device's browser. This will download the app to
your Android device. Then visit the Downloads folder (choosing the
menu option in the browser) where you can click on the
`filepod.apk` file. Your browser will ask if you would like to
installing the app locally.

## Linux

[filepod_amd64.deb](https://solidcommunity.au/installers/filepod_amd64.deb)
and install:

```bash
wget https://solidcommunity.au/installers/filepod_amd64.deb -O filepod_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg --install filepod_amd64.deb
```

To install for the local user and to make it known to GNOME and KDE
with a desktop icon for their desktop (which is automatically done
using the deb or snap installations), begin by downloading the **zip**
and installing that into a local folder:

```

Then set up your local installation (only required once):

ln -s ${HOME}/.local/share/filepod/filepod ${HOME}/.local/bin/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anusii/filepod/dev/installers/app.desktop -O ${HOME}/.local/share/applications/filepod.desktop
sed -i "s/USER/$(whoami)/g" ${HOME}/.local/share/applications/filepod.desktop
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/
wget https://github.com/anusii/filepod/raw/dev/installers/app.png -O ${HOME}/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/filepod.png
```

To install for any user on the computer:

```bash
sudo unzip filepod-linux.zip -d /opt/filepod
sudo ln -s /opt/filepod/filepod /usr/local/bin/
